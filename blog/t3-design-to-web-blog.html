                         <p>Mobile first is basically the act of creating your design starting with the smallest device so when you get to the bigger devices you can spread your wings so to speak.</p>

                    <h1>What frameworks are and their pros and cons?</h1>
                         <p>You basically have two frameworks.  You have frontend and backend.  The frontend deals with the look based on languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, etc.  The backend is the server side and logic behind the website.  Pros and cons of these frameworks varies from it speeds up the mock-up process, but on the other hand mixes content.  Code is usually clean and tidy, but there can be unused code.</p>

                    <h1>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h1>
                         <p>A wireframe is a mockup of or example of what you website layout will look like.  There are several reasons to do this, but I see the main one is to have a goal written down for the project you are about to start.  It defines your initial thoughts so you can work on that creation versus trying many code versions first.</p>
