                    <h1>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h1>
                         <p>It's no secret that you have to study your skill.  There are two sayings that I live by and have since I was very young.  The first one is, "The secret to your success is hidden in you daily routine".  The second is, "Action cures fear". At the end of the day if we devote enough time and energy to a project we can eventually succeed.  Some will succeed faster than others which is fine, but as long as you stay the course and keep mentally on-top of the horse you can achieve what you want.</p>

                         <p>The two minutes of mindfulness is a practice that has many benefits wrapped all up in one.  It's a conscious form of meditation that forces you to use your senses in a positive way and gather information to move ahead in a more positive fashion.</p>
