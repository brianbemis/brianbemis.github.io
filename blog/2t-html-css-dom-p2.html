    <h1> Udacity Reflection</h1>
    <h2><em></em> Lesson 1</h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <p>Can you think of an analogy ot describe HTML, CSS, and the DOM?
            Without using the example that Udacity gave in the video I compare HTML to a planned road,  CSS will determine if that road is gravel, sand, concrete or some other material and DOM will determine if the road is straight, curves or stops.
    
    <p>What is meant by boxifying?
        
        Boxifying is means that every element on a web page is contained in a rectangle or box.  You basically design a website with boxes.  The page itself is one big box with other boxes inside.
        

    <p> What  is the box model?
        
        Knowing everything is a box we can define several areas within and outside the box.
        
        - Content - The actual content inside the box, e.g. text
        - Padding - The space between the content and the border of the box.
        - Border - The border of the box
        - Margin - The space between this box and other boxes
