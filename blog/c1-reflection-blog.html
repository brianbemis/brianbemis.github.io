    <h1> A Journey for Redemption</h1>
    <h2><em></em> Tackling School</h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <p>The EDA experience was full of surprises this week. Holy cow!  Let’s just be honest here.  I quit school in 1981 in the 10th grade.  I’ve taken tons of classes that were a couple of weeks long, but never have I faced anything this intense.  I am not a college graduate so I never have challenged myself this much.  The ability to stay focused and not get overwhelmed is my key to success I believe.

    <p>One part of me is scared to death and the other part of me is saying it’s not going to beat me.  I will win the battle and get through this.  The material is foreign to me since my daily job is more of a legal, financial and accounting capacity.  I think all of us can learn, we must take that first step and dive into deep water.  The deep water is where the treasure lies.

    <p>Fitting in should not be a problem.  I’ve been to New Zealand many times and that’s why I decided to come to this part of the world instead of the United States.  I find the people in New Zealand no matter what country they are from just awesome and fun to be around.  If people can take my corny jokes and small pranks (rubber spider) then I see myself blending easy.  If the tensions are high I will bring beer, wine, cider or sodas to calm people down (smiling).

    </p>The excitement of just leaving the U.S. and being gone for almost three months is crazy cool to me.  I’ve never left my family for longer than 16 days and that was a trip to New Zealand back December of 2014.  The only thing I am nervous about is slowing someone else up.  I don’t like to be a burden or inconvenience anyone, but if people are truly working together we will all have our strong points and weak points to help each other along.
