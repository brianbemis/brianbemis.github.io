                    <h1>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS, and the DOM?</h1>
                         <p>Without using the example that Udacity gave in the video I compare HTML to a planned road,  CSS will determine if that road is gravel, sand, concrete or some other material and DOM will determine if the road is straight, curves or stops.</p>

                    <h1>What is meant by boxifying?</h1>
                         <p>Boxifying means that every element on a web page is contained in a rectangle or box.  You basically design a website with boxes.  The page itself is one big box with other boxes inside.</p>

                         <p>Knowing everything is a box we can define several areas within and outside the box.</p>
