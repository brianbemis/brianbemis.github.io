                    <h1>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h1>
                         <p>The HTML language is interpreted by the Web browser, and it delivers the images and text for the user. JavaScript is a more advanced language to make Web pages dynamic. Both these languages have differences, but they are used in unison to present website. The hypertext markup programmed for a Web page is static.</p>
                         <p>CSS is used for desiging and formatting webpages.  Both JavasScript and CSS work with HTML</p>

                         <p>A control flow modifies a program's control flow and loops are structures which repeat their statements while the environment is validated by a given test or condition.</p>

                         <p>An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is either a data property, or an accessor property.   As Arrays are objects they share everything that were already mentioned</p>

                    <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
                         <p>Functions lie at the core of practically everything useful that you’ll do with JavaScript. Broadly speaking, they offer the ability to break a program into logical chunks, each implementing a specific piece of functionality. They’re a central feature of the language, and a good chunk of JavaScript’s attractiveness is due to the particular ways in which it enables you to use and create functions.
