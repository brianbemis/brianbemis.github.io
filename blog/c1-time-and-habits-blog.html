                         <p>I wanted to laugh out loud when I read this question of which timebox and habits did you try. The fact is I didn't. I was running around like a chicken with his head cut off this week. I closed my businesses so I could focus on this full-time and I am busier now with no job then before. On a positive note I did make sure my daughter got her driving skills in this week and the best thing of all she passed her entrance exam to the University. She hasn't even graduated high school. She's is only in the 10th grade and is about to start college. So technically, I did have some good fatherly habits in looking out for my daughter's interest.
